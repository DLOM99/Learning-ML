### Defintion 
 
Machine learning is a branch of the artificial intelligence discipline where we use different techniques and algorithms to teach the computer how to perform a task. 

~Another Definition~ 

Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they can learn from data.

A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance
measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. â€”Tom Mitchell, 1997


1. Use of Machine learning : 

 - Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of fine-tuning or long lists of rules: one Machine
Learning algorithm can often simplify code and perform better than the traditional approach.
 - Complex problems for which using a traditional approach yields no good solution: the best Machine
Learning techniques can perhaps find a solution.
 - Fluctuating environments: a Machine Learning system can adapt to new data.
 - Getting insights about complex problems and large amounts of data.

 2. Types of Machine learning : 

 - Whether or not they are trained with human supervision (supervised, unsupervised, semisupervised, and
Reinforcement Learning)
 - Whether or not they can learn incrementally on the fly (online versus batch learning)
 - Whether they work by simply comparing new data points to known data points, or instead by detecting
patterns in the training data and building a predictive model, much like scientists do (instance-based
versus model-based learning)

 2. Main challenge of machine learning 
 When working with machine learning, 2 challenges usually rise and are more important than others :
  - Bad data 
  - Bad algorithm 


  2. 1 Bad data 
  
  Various form of bad data can arise as issues, namely :
  - insufficient quantity of training data 
  - Nonrepresentative training data 
  - Poor-quality data 
  - Irelevant features.
